See dogs for days!

This is an exercise to help me understand how to use APIs:
- Fetch JSON from an endpoint
- Create an input field that takes in any number between 1 to 50 from the DOM. 
- Take number from input field and edit the endpoint URL.
- Use promises to asynchronously add images of dogs to the buttom of an appended list of dogs.
- Clear an element every time a new number of dogs are entered.
- Use for loop and append multiple images from an array provided in the API response.
