This is an exercise to help understand how to use APIs:
- Fetch from an endpoint
- Creating a input field that takes in any number between 1 to 50 in the DOM. 
- Take number from input field and edit the endpoint to take inputted number.
- Use promises to asynchronously added images of dogs to the buttom of the appended list (images) of dogs.
- Use for loop and append multiple images from an array provided in the API response.
